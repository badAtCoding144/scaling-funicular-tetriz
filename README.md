1v1 tetris for those who want to play a knock off :)

I didn't create an issue for this but if you're reading this just know theres a problem with collision so your block can spawn and if you're holding an input key it could just get stuck at the top - also there aren't win conditions but the score is done where if you play faster you get more score so it's basically a race - it was a bug and is now a feature.
Also I you use the arrow keys to play with the up arrow key being used to rotate your blocks.
